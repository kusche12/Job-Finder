# Job-Finder
React Native application that allows the user to search a map to find, rank, and save jobs specific to location

## How it works
1. The user is prompted with a "Landing Page" that details the instructions of the app
2. The user is prompted to "Sign in" or "Log in"
3. The user can scroll on a map and search for jobs specific to any location
4. The user can "Like" or "Ignore" different job opportunities using a Tindr based UI
5. The user can view a list of all of their liked jobs at any time!

## Please Note!
At the time of building this project, the Indeed job list API had been unaccessible to the public. For the completion of this application, I implemented a Jobs API that enters 10 jobs that can be accessed by the user. Other than this, the application is fully functional to the user
